## Intended users
 * low-income user: 
 > As a low-income user with a limited budget. I want to use SmartCheff because it allows me to input ingredients I have on hand and be presented with a list of new ways to combine and cook meals with those ingredients. 
 * professional Chef
 > As a professional Chef, I am always looking for new recipes. I use SmartCheff because when I input any number of ingredients I am presented with a lot of different ways to combine and cook those ingredients.  
 * A beginner cook:
 > As a beginner cook, I use SmartCheff because I have little to no experience cooking. SmartCheff allows me to input the ingredients I have and quickly find recipes as a resource I can use to increase my experience and knowledge of cooking.
